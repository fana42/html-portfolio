<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Fana Hagos, a senior at the University of Washington pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. 
  With hands-on experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Geeking Out Kids of Color, I've developed features for the Allyship App using 
  Angular and Ionic, including a text-to-speech feature to support BIPOC allyship. I've also led the development of HuskyPal, a web app 
  designed to improve student engagement at UW, focusing on both frontend and backend development. I'm proficient in Java, JavaScript, and React,
  and I'm passionate about creating impactful software solutions that drive user engagement and enhance accessibility.
